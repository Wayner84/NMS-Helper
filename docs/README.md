# Media Placeholders

Add updated screenshots and gifs for key flows here before release:

- `docs/screenshots/` – high-resolution captures of each tab (mobile + desktop).
- `docs/gifs/` – short looped recordings of planner optimisation, portal copy/share, and notes bulk tagging.

Current build ships without media assets so that the repository stays lightweight.
